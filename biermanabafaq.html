-	No single words by 16 months or two word phrases by age 2<br/>
-	Repeats exactly what others say without understanding the meaning<br/>
-	Child does not respond to name<br/>
-	Difficulty making or maintaining eye contact<br/>
-	Does not point to indicate needs or wants<br/>
-	Repetitive, stereotyped behavior<br/>

Childhood signs include:<br/>

-	Difficulty maintaining or keeping eye contact. <br/>
-	Unable to perceive others feelings or thoughts via facial expressions<br/>
-	Uninterested in or unable to make friends with peers<br/>
-	Pronoun confusion<br/>
-	Does not start or difficulty continuing a conversation<br/>
-	Difficulty using toys or objects for pretend play<br/>
-	Rote memory for numbers, letters, books, songs, but unable to answer conversational questions.<br/> 
-	Insists on routines, difficulty with change, obsessions with rituals<br/>
-	Obsessed with (often unusual) activities, repeating them continuously throughout the day.<br/>
                      </ul>

The aforementioned behaviors are not immediate indicators of autism. However, if you have observed any of these behaviors, contact your pediatrician immediately for information about the evaluation process.

Your BCBA will:<br/>

 - Observe your child's behavior in a variety of environments, to develop an accurate picture of his or her current learning strengths and needs. <br/>

- Interact with your child weekly to assess your child’s language, behavior, social interaction, and other developmental domains. <br/>

- train family members, so that your child will use his or her new skills across the many people and places in his or her natural environment<br/>

<p>ABA as a practice has continued to evolve and improve over time.  In it’s earliest form, before insurance mandates existed allowing families to access services through medical insurance, therapy was often performed by parents instead of highly trained professionals.  A majority of services also were also only performed in the home as the only option. <br/></p>

<p>But as the field continues grow and evolve and more and more states pass insurance mandates, the center-based model has developed and become an option for families.  The center-based model has many advantages to a home program, which includes a higher level of supervision oversight and training to BT’s implementing the programming designed by the BCBA, a safer environment for children with severe challenging behavior, access to peers to work on necessary play and social skills, and more contact and oversight by the child’s BCBA to monitor the child’s program and make frequent data-based decisions on programming to faster accelerate a child’s learning.  This has been our experience as an organization as we started out only providing home services and quickly changed to a center model with home services available as needed.  <br/></p>

                    <blockquote><p>  Absolutely, and we program different than most ABA providers.  The ability for a child to generalize skills is not necessarily determined by the environment therapy takes place but the way programming is designed. <br/></p> 

<p>A common practice within ABA is to teach with multiple exemplars or using a random set of stimuli and then testing for generalization and discrimination following the mastery of skills within the set of targeted stimuli.  The problem with this is skills do not often generalize to different stimuli and different environments as the child will often respond incorrectly if all variable features of the skill concept are not systematically controlled for during instruction.  The child’s inability to generalize into the home environment is often a result of poor programming that lead to the development of faulty stimulus control (i.e. teaching the child to respond only under a specific set of conditions and not  adequately programming for all conditions).  The child then learns to attend to the wrong stimuli when responding and makes generalize and discriminate errors. We program differently to prevent this from happening by programming for generalization and discrimination within our skill programming (Tiemann & Markle, 1990).<br/></p> 






<p><i>Examples of place of treatment decisions for ABA programming:</i> The following are a few examples<br/></p> 

<p>Example- It was reported during the IA the child has difficulty cooperating with other children and will also engage in challenging behavior such as hitting other children.  Parents reported the child will also often his younger sibling at home.  We would write a program to decelerate hitting peers.  Deceleration of the skill will be targeted with children in the center with peers and home sessions scheduled to target this specific problem in the home to build cooperation with the younger sibling.  <br/></p> 

<p>Example – It was reported during the IA the child only engages in challenging behavior in the home and not in any other environments, such as school.  It would then be recommended for the child to receive all therapy in the home as there is no need for center-based program as challenges are isolated to the home environment only. <br/></p>

	    			<p class="access-p">Bierman ABA was established in 2006 with a simple focus on providing great therapy for children with autism and on building a unique, awesome and friendly work culture. Since then, it has been truly gratifying to have helped so many children and to have watched their progress with things such as signs, speech and behavioral development. As we’ve grown, we’ve kept a laser sharp focus on our mission and founding principles.</p>
