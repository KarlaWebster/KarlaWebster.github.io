            <p>Abbie attended Franklin College and graduated in 2013 with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in sociology. She found her passion working with children who have disabilities when she was in high school and since then has worked with children with autism.

It is her passion in life to help change the lives of children with disabilities and to watch these children grow into the best individuals they can be. In her free time, Abbie likes to go to the lake, camp, boat, play soccer, and hang out with friends, family, and her puppy Delilah. </p>

She attended Plymouth State University where she played on the Division III Women's Ice Hockey team before transferring to Bridgewater State University, where she earned her BA in English. Nichole comes to Bierman after teaching at a public elementary school as a special education teacher. During her time there, she worked as a math interventionist and reading teacher, and was a one-to-one paraprofessional for a little boy with a dual diagnosis of Autism and Down Syndrome. Nichole thrives in a leadership role. In high school, she was the captain of two varsity programs, and went on to receive the Boston Bruins Sportsmanship Award for outstanding leadership and sportsmanship. From there she volunteered and ran the "Learn to Play" clinic for children. After college, Nichole became the volunteer assistant coach for a girl’s high school hockey team for five years. As a child, Nichole was diagnosed with a learning disability and struggled with reading and writing. She couldn't keep up with her peers and was put on an Individual Education Plan where she excelled with the help of inclusion instruction and separate classrooms. Once she was old enough to attend her IEP meetings, she decided she wanted to help children who may learn differently. Her time at Plymouth State gave her an opportunity to co-teach at a school for at-risk youths where she ultimately developed a passion for teaching. Nichole believes in the power of inspiration and carries this with her in life and in her career, and is excited to be a member of the Bierman ABA team.</p>
