    <h4>Abigail Goss</h4>
            <p>Abbie attended Franklin College and graduated in 2013 with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in sociology. She found her passion working with children who have disabilities when she was in high school and since then has worked with children with autism. Abbie was not sure what career path she wanted to take with children until she heard of ABA, and she immediately knew that this was what she wanted to do. It is her passion in life to help change the lives of children with disabilities and to watch these children grow into the best individuals they can be. In her free time, Abbie likes to go to the lake, camp, boat, play soccer, and hang out with friends, family, and her puppy Delilah. </p>

	    			<p class="access-p">Bierman ABA was established in 2006 with a simple focus on providing great therapy for children with autism and on building a unique, awesome and friendly work culture. Since then, it has been truly gratifying to have helped so many children and to have watched their progress with things such as signs, speech and behavioral development. As we’ve grown, we’ve kept a laser sharp focus on our mission and founding principles.</p>
