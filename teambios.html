Nichole comes to Bierman after teaching at a public elementary school as a special education teacher. During her time there, she worked as a math interventionist and reading teacher, and was a one-to-one paraprofessional for a little boy with a dual diagnosis of Autism and Down Syndrome. Nichole thrives in a leadership role. In high school, she was the captain of two varsity programs, and went on to receive the Boston Bruins Sportsmanship Award for outstanding leadership and sportsmanship. From there she volunteered and ran the "Learn to Play" clinic for children. After college, Nichole became the volunteer assistant coach for a girl’s high school hockey team for five years. As a child, Nichole was diagnosed with a learning disability and struggled with reading and writing. She couldn't keep up with her peers and was put on an Individual Education Plan where she excelled with the help of inclusion instruction and separate classrooms. Once she was old enough to attend her IEP meetings, she decided she wanted to help children who may learn differently. Her time at Plymouth State gave her an opportunity to co-teach at a school for at-risk youths where she ultimately developed a passion for teaching. Nichole believes in the power of inspiration and carries this with her in life and in her career, and is excited to be a member of the Bierman ABA team.</p>
