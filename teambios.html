    <h4>Abigail Goss</h4>
            <p>Abbie attended Franklin College and graduated in 2013 with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in sociology. She found her passion working with children who have disabilities when she was in high school and since then has worked with children with autism. Abbie was not sure what career path she wanted to take with children until she heard of ABA, and she immediately knew that this was what she wanted to do. It is her passion in life to help change the lives of children with disabilities and to watch these children grow into the best individuals they can be. In her free time, Abbie likes to go to the lake, camp, boat, play soccer, and hang out with friends, family, and her puppy Delilah. </p>

IUDM is an annual weekend dance-a-thon where college students stand and dance for 36 straight hours to raise money for the children of Riley Children's Hospital, all while playing and interacting with the kids. Alexandra loves helping kids to grown and overcome their obstacles. In her free time, Alexandra loves to travel. She backpacked around Europe for 70 days after graduation. She also loves to read, be outdoors, practice yoga, and spend time with her family, friends, and multiple pets. </p>

	    			<p class="access-p">Bierman ABA was established in 2006 with a simple focus on providing great therapy for children with autism and on building a unique, awesome and friendly work culture. Since then, it has been truly gratifying to have helped so many children and to have watched their progress with things such as signs, speech and behavioral development. As we’ve grown, we’ve kept a laser sharp focus on our mission and founding principles.</p>
