			<h3>A Day in the Life of a Child at Bierman ABA</h3>
			<p>During the early weeks of ABA, your child will become familiar with members of his or her team, while the team learns all about your child’s strengths, skills, needs, behaviors, and learning styles. <br/>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the first people your family will meet is your child’s Behavior Analyst, often referred to as a consultant. Consultants have an advanced education (masters degree or advances course series), have met the requirements of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACB) for specified coursework in behavior analysis and supervised hours of practical experience, and have passed a national credentialing examination, which must be maintained with continuing education. <br/>
             <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the first few weeks, consultants will use several different evaluation tools to design a personalized intervention and skill development plan for your child.  Since we keep our consultant case load extremely low, your child will have interaction with the consultant multiple times during the week. The consultant will work diligently using the most up-to date curricula, ABA methods, and scientific data evaluation techniques to ensure progress. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The consultant works with a team of ABA therapists, who will work with your child daily 1:1. Our ABA therapist specialize is learning your child’s motivation to make learning fun and engaging, while maximizing opportunities to practice skills. Our therapist specialize in Natural Environment Teaching, a method while disguises learning as play, to keep the learner constantly engaged while maximizing the number of learning opportunities. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While our commitment to constant evaluation, natural environment teaching, and having the best team possible for your child are consistent across all our programs. Depending on your child’s skills and needs, each child’s day may look very different, but there are some things you may see in our centers:<br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
   <p> Children spending a large part of the day in a mock classroom setting participating in activities to prepare them for a future school setting. Bierman ABA offers a unique classroom setting for learners who may soon transition into a school setting. The classroom creates an environment that closely mimics an elementary learner’s school day, complete with activities such as circle time, centers, art, lunch, and music. Subject areas including Math and Language are also targeted daily through direct instruction curriculums.  A therapist who acts as the “teacher” leads the learners through the daily activities, and each learner has a therapist to provide support and prompting as needed. Individualized programs are still implemented, with two intensive therapy times provided throughout the day.<br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early learners working on sounds, signs, and other communication while playing in a giant playroom. For our early learners, building communication is everything. We build intensive programs focused on helping children to express their needs, as well as social communication. Our success comes with pairing these times of high brain development, with high rates of skill acquisition. We reach children’s maximum language potential by using the natural environment to teach language to fluency. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Family and friends participating in daily social groups that focus on communication, play, and daily living skills. While maintaining a 1:1 ratio, our children participate in group settings daily. Groups include play groups, social groups, mealtime groups, and community outings. We also have several opportunities for family, friends, and other community members. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
